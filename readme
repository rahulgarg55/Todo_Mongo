controllers: Contains the logic to handle requests and responses.
models: Contains the MongoDB schema definition for tasks.
routes: Contains the route definitions for CRUD operations.
app.js: Main entry point for the Node.js backend.
package.json: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
Frontend:

public: Contains the HTML file which serves as the entry point for the React application.
src/components: Contains React components for displaying tasks, adding tasks, and editing tasks.
src/App.js: Main component where other components are imported and rendered.
src/index.js: Entry point for the React application.
src/index.css: CSS file for styling the application.

Now, for the functionalities:

Backend:

Set up a Node.js server using Express.
Define routes for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on tasks.
Implement controllers to handle the logic for each route, interacting with MongoDB using Mongoose.
Frontend:

Create components for displaying tasks, adding tasks, and editing tasks.
Use React state to manage the task data and form inputs.
Implement CRUD operations by making HTTP requests to the backend API using Axios or Fetch API.
